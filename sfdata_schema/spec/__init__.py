"""
The schema specification package contains the classes that define the schema of a data set. The schema is a
description of the structure of the data set. It contains the definition of the fields, their types and the
relationships between them.

The classes in this package are used to define the schema of a data set and are purely descriptive. 

There are other packages containing code that can be used to build a validator for the schema, to generate
documentation or to convert data from one schema to another.
